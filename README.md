# Adams-Bashforth method for differential equations

This project implements the **third-order Adams-Bashforth method** for solving linear first- and second-order differential equations. The initial values \( y_1, y_2 \) are computed using the **third-order Runge-Kutta method**.

## Additional remark
This project was created as part of coursework for numerical methods 2 classes.
